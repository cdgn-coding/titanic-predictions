# Titanic predictions

This project is a solution for the [*Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster*](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), a competition from Kaggle. The goal is that given a set gathered data about passagers which we know if they survived or not, then predict which of the passagers in another set have survived.
